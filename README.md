NU CBC Homework #10 - Week #12 - Node.js &amp; MySQL Retailer App

Bamazon is a node CLI app built with a MySQL database. My version of bamazon contains some essential camping and outdoor gear for your next big adventure.
There are two CLIs for bamazon:
* customer interface
* manager interface

## Customer Interface:
To make a purchase from Bamazon:
* download the repository and call that directory in the terminal.
* Enter `node bamazonCustomer.js` into the command line. A list of products will be displayed with their cost.
* Follow the prompts on the screen!
